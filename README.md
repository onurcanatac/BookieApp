# BookieApp
Bookie is planned to be desktop application to exchange second-hand textbooks. 
Inside the application, users will post a textbook and wait for a buyer in their local area 
to reach them. After the seller has been contacted, they can decide on a price, and a meeting 
place to trade the textbook. This application is designed to benefit both active students and 
alumni since people will earn money by selling books they do not use anymore and buy the books 
they need for a cheaper price.

Since this is a unfinished group project, parts that I implemented or contributed can be found here.
